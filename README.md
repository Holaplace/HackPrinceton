# Hack Princeton
Made by Can Cui, Jeremy Malloch, and Stephen Jia

###Project Description
We created a sign language interpreter using the Myo armband, Azure cloud services, and a bit Python, C++, and Java. 

###Improvements
Potential improvements could include incorporating a second Myo armband for increased classification accuary.  This would probably use the Myo-Raw library, which we unfortunately didn't have time to use.  The features selected could also be improved.

###More Information
Our project is briefly described on [Devpost](http://devpost.com/software/wearable-machine-learning-sign-language-translator)

#####Lastly, shoutout Steph for being a great host at Princeton
